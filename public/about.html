<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I, Tesleem Oyelakin, am a Mechanical Engineering graduate majoring in Production Engineering with over 4 years of experience. I have two Bachelor's and Master's degree in the aforementioned profession with diplomas in Strategic Human Resource Management, Mechanical Design and Project Management. Recently, I have taken some courses in Data Analysis and Software Development to deepen my knowledge and at the same time equip myself with everything necessary to be able to face the challenges in the IT profession. Among the sites I have visited and signed up for include Codeinstitute, Maven Institute, Codefinity and Udemy. The latter is where I am currently studying and working on my web development project to become a WEB DEVELOPER.

<p>I am a calm, realiable and goal-oriented person with great communication skills. I would see any opportunity in Software Development as a way to contribute to the journey of Artificial Intelligence (AI) etc and I feel I can do that with my resilient attitude. I don't just do things, like to achieve outstanding result. I always want to be a better person and like to make a positive difference in the lives of others through work dexterity. Moreso, highly adept at handling various responsibilities by prioritizing my tasks, establishing clear deadlines, and finding creative solutions to eliminate obstacles.

<p>While I am grateful for the opportunity I have been given in my career pursuit, I am ready to continue the path that offers new challenges to use my skills to become a better person.
<p>It would be a great pleasure to speak with you. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate and feel free to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
